**Currently, I am actively developing the [Semiprime Factorization](https://github.com/entangledloops/heuristicSearch/tree/master/SemiprimeFactor) subproject in this repo. Take a look!**

## What is Heuristic Search? ##

Heuristic search is a problem solving technique that uses [heuristic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_function) to guide a search through a [state space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space).

It refers to a broad class of algorithms that can be adapted to a variety of problem domains. The most well-known heuristic search technique is probably [A*](https://github.com/entangledloops/heuristicSearch/wiki/A*) (pronounced "A star").

## What is it used for? ##

You may be familiar with its application in games, as it is often used to solve pathfinding problems. For example, when a player clicks on a location for his character to move to, a heuristic search algorithm is often working behind the scenes to find a path.

## Where can I learn more? ##

You can read more on [this project's wiki page](https://github.com/entangledloops/heuristicSearch/wiki), artifical intelligence related websites, and in the few books dedicated to the topic.
