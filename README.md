This repository holds code to be reused in other search projects.

Currently, I'm developing the [Semiprime Factorization](https://github.com/entangledloops/semiprime) app to attempt cracking RSA public keys through heuristic search. This project is currently using code many versions ahead of this repo and has not been merged back in some time, so please defer to that project for now.

To learn more about heuristic search, [checkout the wiki](https://github.com/entangledloops/heuristic-search/wiki/Heuristic-Search-Project-Wiki).
